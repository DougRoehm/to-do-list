# to-do-list
This program will allow a user to create and manage a simple to-do-list.

I envision it having the following functionality:
- It will allow a user to enter items on the list.
- They can press ctrl-d to exit entering items on the list.
- They can see a printout of the items on the list.
- They can remove items on the list.
